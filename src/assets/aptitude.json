      "given": "Distance traveled downstream: 160 kilometers, Time taken: 4 hours, Speed of the boat in still water: 40 kilometers per hour",
      "answer": "Speed of the stream: 30 kilometers per hour",
      "explanation": "To calculate the speed of the stream, subtract the speed of the boat in still water from the speed of the boat downstream: Speed of the stream = Speed of the boat downstream - Speed of the boat in still water = 40 kilometers per hour - 10 kilometers per hour = 30 kilometers per hour.",
